# Python-Basics
## This project encompasses some functions in Python and their uses. 
### This project contains two(2) files :
1. [PROJECT 1](data_structures.ipynb) : This projcet demonstrate my skills and expertise in different data types in Python `(list, tuple, set, string, dictionary, e.t.c)`, and how I was able to convert from one data structure to the other. ðŸ˜Š
```
A_list = [23, 24.5, "book", "school", 32, 29, 28.9, "estate", "country", 78.2]
A_tuple = (10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 43, 45, 65, "girl", "boy", "male")
A_set = {"big", "small", "slim", "fat", 23, 21, 34.2, 26,8, 87.2, 66}

```
   
2. [PROJECT 2](elif_statement.ipynb) : In this file, I used **conditional statement** such as `IF-ELSE`, and **loop statements** such as `FOR loop` and `WHILE loop` to solve basic problems in Python. ðŸ˜„

```
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("%s is %d years old." %(name,age))
```

```
x = 5
while x<=55:
    print(x)
    x +=5
    print(x)
```
