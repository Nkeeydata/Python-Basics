# Python-Basics
## This project encompasses some functions in Python and their uses. 
### This project contains two(2) files :
1. [PROJECT 1](data_structures.ipynb) : This projcet demonstrate my skills and expertise in different data types in Python (list, tuple, set, string, dictionary, e.t.c), and how I was able to convert from one data structure to the other. ðŸ˜Š
2. [PROJECT 2](elif_statement.ipynb) : In this file, I used **conditional statement** such as `IF-ELSE`, and **loop statements** such as `FOR loop` and `WHILE loop` to solve basic problems in Python. ðŸ˜„
